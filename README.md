# Streaming Pipeline
#### Select a workshop to discover end-to-end implementation examples that feature streaming, machine learning, and analytics using a synthetic manufacturing data.

[Level 100: Streaming to Analytics](./level-100-streaming-to-analytics/README.md)
> Deploy an end-to-end streaming pipeline covering the flow of manufacturing data from stream ingestion to analytical visualization on Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI).

[Level 200: Anomaly Detection ML](./level-200-anomaly-detection-ml/README.md)
> Deploy a version of the streaming pipeline that includes a machine learning layer to detect anomalies in manufacturing data.
