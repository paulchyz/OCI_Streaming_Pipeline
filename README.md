# Streaming Pipeline

### Introduction
Data streaming is a powerful tool capable of accelerating business processes and facilitating real-time decision-making across a wide variety of industries and use cases. There are many ways to implement streaming technology, and each solution offers different benefits and drawbacks. The approach documented in this repository is a cloud-native, low-code approach to streaming, covering the complete data lifecycle from ingestion to analysis. This will enable organizations to implement a complete streaming pipeline quickly, without the need to spend valuable time and effort procuring, configuring and managing IT infrastructure.

There are two versions of this pipeline. Level 100 covers the core streaming pipeline. Level 200 contains a version of the streaming pipeline that includes machine learning for anomaly detection. See below for additional information.

[Level 100: Streaming to Analytics](./level-100-streaming-to-analytics/README.md)
> Deploy an end-to-end streaming pipeline covering the flow of manufacturing data from stream ingestion to analytical visualization on Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI).

[Level 200: Anomaly Detection ML](./level-200-anomaly-detection-ml/README.md)
> Deploy a version of the streaming pipeline that includes a machine learning layer to detect anomalies in manufacturing data.
